#Many modules are provided dual-license, either GPL or LGPL at your

#The following packages are needed by maintainers for using

#distributions that may lag behind the latest stable package.
#Support for older versions is not guaranteed, though, and

#Gnulib
#======
#
#While portability across operating systems is not one of GNU's primary
#goals, it has helped introduce many people to the GNU system, and is
#worthwhile when it can be achieved at a low cost.  This collection helps
#lower that cost.
#
#Gnulib is intended to be the canonical source for most of the important
#"portability" and/or common files for GNU projects.  These are files
#intended to be shared at the source level; Gnulib is not a typical
#library meant to be installed and linked against.  Thus, unlike most
#projects, Gnulib does not normally generate a source tarball
#distribution; instead, developers grab modules directly from the
#source repository.

#Legal Issues about Contributing Code to GNU	last updated 8 Feb 2009
#
#Project GNU has to be careful to obey copyright laws, even though
#these laws are wrong when they stop people from sharing generally
#useful published information such as software, because we are in the
#public eye.  We also use copyright to defend users' freedom, by means
#of copyleft (though this does not excuse copyright law for helping
#to make software proprietary).
#
#This means that if you want to contribute software to GNU, you have to
#do something to give us legal permission to use it.  There are three
#ways this can be done:
#
#* Assign the copyright to the Free Software Foundation.
#This allows the FSF to act to stop violations of the GPL.

#@node Benefits
#@section Benefits of using Gnulib
#
#Gnulib is useful to enhance various aspects of a package:
#
#@itemize @bullet
#@item
#Portability: With Gnulib, a package maintainer can program against the
#POSIX and GNU libc APIs and nevertheless expect good portability to
#platforms that don't implement POSIX.
#
#@item
#Maintainability: When a package uses modules from Gnulib instead of code
#written specifically for that package, the maintainer has less code to
#maintain.

#The @code{lib-msvc-compat} module detects whether the linker supports
#@code{--output-def} when building a library.  That parameter is used
#to generate a DEF file for a shared library (DLL).  DEF files are
#useful for developers that use Visual Studio to develop programs that
#links to your library.  See the GNU LD manual for more information.
#
#There are other ways to create a DEF file, but we believe they are all
#sub-optimal to using @code{--output-def} during the build process.

#@section LD Version Scripts
#
#The @code{lib-symbol-versions} module can be used to add shared
#library versioning support.  Currently, only GNU LD and the Solaris
#linker supports this.
#
#Version scripts provides information that can be used by GNU/Linux
#distribution packaging tools.  For example, Debian has a tool
#@code{dpkg-shlibdeps} that can determine the minimal required version
#of each dependency (by looking at the symbol list) and stuff the
#information into the Debian specific packaging files.
#
#For more information and other uses of version scripts, see Ulrich

#
#It has been a pain for many users of GNU packages for a long time that
#packages are not relocatable.  It means a user cannot copy a program,
#installed by another user on the same machine, to his home directory,
#and have it work correctly (including i18n).  So many users need to go
#through @code{configure; make; make install} with all its
#dependencies, options, and hurdles.
#
#Red Hat, Debian, and similar package systems solve the ``ease of
#installation'' problem, but they hardwire path names, usually to

#privileges to install a binary package, and prevents installing two
#different versions of the same binary package.

  (Mostly) portable public-domain implementation -- D A Gwyn
#
#   This implementation of the PWB library alloca function,
#   which is used to allocate space off the run-time stack so
#   that it is automatically reclaimed upon procedure exit,
#   was inspired by discussions with J. Q. Johnson of Cornell.
#   J.Otto Tennant <jot@cray.com> contributed the Cray support.
#
#   There are some preprocessor constants that can
#   be defined when compiling for your specific system, for
#   improved efficiency; however, the defaults should be okay.
#
#   The general concept of this implementation is to keep
#   track of all alloca-allocated blocks, and reclaim any

#That's hard without a systematic approach, but here is a set of conventions

#
#- The lib/ sources are split into modules.  Usually the module of a
#  lib/foo.h and lib/foo.c is called "foo" - not unexpected, hey! -, but
#  in more ambiguous cases you can look up the module a file belongs to
#  by doing "grep lib/foo.c modules/*".
#
#- For every module there is an autoconf macro file, usually called
#  m4/foo.m4 according to the module name.  When you modify lib/foo.h or
#  lib/foo.c, remember to modify m4/foo.m4 as well!
#  What if you don't find m4/foo.m4? This probably means that the module

## Note: If the type 'long long int' exists but is only 32 bits large
## (as on some very old compilers), HAVE_LONG_LONG_INT will not be
## defined. In this case you can treat 'long long int' like 'long int'.

## See if we need to work around bugs in glibc's implementation of
## utimes from 2003-07-12 to 2003-09-17.
## First, there was a bug that would make utimes set mtime
## and atime to zero (1970-01-01) unconditionally.
## Then, there was code to round rather than truncate.
## Then, there was an implementation (sparc64, Linux-2.4.28, glibc-2.3.3)
## that didn't honor the NULL-means-set-to-current-time semantics.
## Finally, there was also a version of utimes that failed on read-only
